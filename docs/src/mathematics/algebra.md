# Algebra

Giac.jl provides powerful symbolic algebra capabilities including polynomial factorization, expansion, simplification, equation solving, and polynomial arithmetic.

## Setup

```julia
using Giac
using Giac.Commands: factor, expand, simplify, solve, gcd, lcm, quo, rem

@giac_var x y
```

## Polynomial Factorization

### Factoring Polynomials

Factor polynomials into irreducible factors using the `factor` command:

```julia
factor(x^2 - 1)
# Output: (x-1)*(x+1)

factor(x^2 - 4)
# Output: (x-2)*(x+2)

factor(x^2 + 2*x + 1)
# Output: (x+1)^2
```

### Factoring Higher-Degree Polynomials

```julia
factor(x^3 - 1)
# Output: (x-1)*(x^2+x+1)

factor(x^4 - 1)
# Output: (x-1)*(x+1)*(x^2+1)
```

## Polynomial Expansion

### Expanding Products

Expand products and powers of polynomials using the `expand` command:

```julia
expand((x + 1)^2)
# Output: x^2+2*x+1

expand((x + 1)^3)
# Output: x^3+3*x^2+3*x+1

expand((x - 1) * (x + 1))
# Output: x^2-1
```

### Expanding More Complex Expressions

```julia
expand((x + 2) * (x - 3) * (x + 1))
# Expands to full polynomial form

expand((x + y)^2)
# Output: x^2+2*x*y+y^2
```

## Simplification

### Simplifying Rational Expressions

Simplify expressions using the `simplify` command:

```julia
simplify((x^2-1)/(x-1))
# Output: x+1

simplify((x^3-x)/(x^2-1))
# Output: x
```

### Simplifying Complex Expressions

```julia
simplify((x^2+2*x+1)/(x+1))
# Output: x+1
```

## Equation Solving

### Solving Polynomial Equations

Solve equations using the `solve` command:

```julia
solve(x^2 - 4, x)
# Output: [-2, 2]

solve(x^2 - 1, x)
# Output: [-1, 1]

solve(x^2 + 2*x + 1, x)
# Output: [-1]
```

### Solving Higher-Degree Equations

```julia
solve(x^3 - 1, x)
# Returns all roots including complex

solve(x^2 - 2, x)
# Output includes sqrt(2) and -sqrt(2)
```

## GCD and LCM

### Greatest Common Divisor

Find the GCD of polynomials using the `gcd` command:

```julia
gcd(x^2 - 1, x - 1)
# Output: x-1

gcd(x^2 - 4, x^2 - 4*x + 4)
# Output: x-2
```

### Least Common Multiple

Find the LCM of polynomials using the `lcm` command:

```julia
lcm(x - 1, x + 1)
# Output: (x-1)*(x+1) or equivalent

lcm(x^2, x^3)
# Output: x^3
```

## Polynomial Division

### Quotient

Compute the quotient of polynomial division using the `quo` command:

```julia
quo(x^3 - 1, x - 1)
# Output: x^2+x+1

quo(x^4, x^2)
# Output: x^2
```

### Remainder

Compute the remainder of polynomial division using the `rem` command:

```julia
rem(x^3, x - 1)
# Output: 1

rem(x^3 + x, x^2 + 1)
# Computes the polynomial remainder
```

### Quotient and Remainder Together

For polynomial division, the relationship `dividend = quotient * divisor + remainder` always holds:

```julia
# For x^3 - 1 divided by x - 1:
# quo(x^3 - 1, x - 1) = x^2 + x + 1
# rem(x^3 - 1, x - 1) = 0
# Verification: (x - 1) * (x^2 + x + 1) = x^3 - 1 ✓
```

## Systems of Equations

### Solving Linear Systems

Solve systems of equations by passing lists of equations and variables:

```julia
@giac_var x y

# System: x + y = 1, x - y = 0
solve([x + y ~ 1, x - y ~ 0], [x, y])
# Output: [[1/2, 1/2]]
```

### Solving Nonlinear Systems

```julia
# System: x^2 + y^2 = 1, x = y
solve([x^2 + y^2 ~ 1, x ~ y], [x, y])
# Returns solutions on the unit circle where x = y
```

## Notes

- All algebraic operations work symbolically, not numerically
- The `~` operator creates equations for use with `solve`
- For numerical solutions, convert results using `to_julia`
- `simplify` may not always produce the simplest form; try `normal` for rational simplification
- `factor` factors over the rationals by default; use `cfactor` for complex factorization
